# Chef OSS Practices

Chef Software and the Habitat Core Plans project have migrated from RFCs to [design proposals](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/contributors/guide/design-proposals.md). 

If you would like to open a new proposal, please follow the [design proposal](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/contributors/guide/design-proposals.md) process and 
open an issue on the [core-plans](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans) repository. 

Thank you for your contributions, and thank you for using Habitat!
