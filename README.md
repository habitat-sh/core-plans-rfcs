# Chef OSS Practices

Chef Software and the Habitat project are migrating from RFCs to [design proposals](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/contributors/guide/design-proposals.md). 
We have opened a number of [issues](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans-rfcs/issues) to track the migration of each RFC to the new format. While this work is in flight, please 
continue to consider the documents in this repository to be valid. 

As we migrate each document, the format will change but we will endeavor to keep the intent of the document in place. If an issue for a particular RFC has been marked complete and 
close, please consider that RFC to be superseded by the corresponding design proposal. 

Once the migration is complete, we will be setting this repository to read-only for a period of one month. After the month has passed, we will be archiving this repository. 

If you would like to open a new RFC, please follow the [design proposal](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/contributors/guide/design-proposals.md) process and 
open an issue on the [core-plans](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans) repository instead. 

Thank you for your contributions, and thank you for using Habitat! 


# RFCs for Habitat core plans

[Habitat Plans](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/concepts-plans/) are packages in the Habitat Core Origin. They are maintained and built by the core maintainers to provide the fundamental base tier of packages used by the [Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/) ecosystem.

This repository contains RFCs for the core-plans community.
